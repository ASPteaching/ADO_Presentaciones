## Presentation

This repository is intended to contain materials for presentations used in Omics Data Analyis courses I am currently teaching.

Some of the presentations are simple introductions to Units or Activities, that is an overview of what is presented in that unit. These are usually the suport for a video introducing the unit.

Other presentations are self contained, that is, they are intended to explain some ideas, with or without a video support.
