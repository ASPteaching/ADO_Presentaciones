abstract = {Determining the order of nucleic acid residues in biological samples is an integral component of a wide variety of research applications. Over the last fifty years large numbers of researchers have applied themselves to the production of techniques and technologies to facilitate this feat, sequencing DNA and RNA molecules. This time-scale has witnessed tremendous changes, moving from sequencing short oligonucleotides to millions of bases, from struggling towards the deduction of the coding sequence of a single gene to rapid and widely available whole genome sequencing. This article traverses those years, iterating through the different generations of sequencing technology, highlighting some of the key discoveries, researchers, and sequences along the way.},

abstract = {DNA sequencing process utilizes biochemical methods in order to determine the correct order of nucleotide bases in a DNA macromolecule using sequencing machines. Ten years ago, sequencing was based on a single type of sequencing that is Sanger sequencing. In 2005, Next Generation Sequencing Technologies emerged and changed the view of the analysis and understanding of living beings. Over the last decade, considerable progress has been made on new sequencing machines. In this paper, we present a non-exhaustive overview of the sequencing technologies by beginning with the first methods history used by the commonly used NGS platforms until today. Our goal is to provide beginners in the field as well as to the amateurs of science a simple and understandable description of NGS technologies in order to provide them with basic knowledge as an initiation into this field in full ardor.},

abstract = {Abstract Long-haul travel does not constitute an obstacle for tourists to travel and is fast gaining the attention of tourists in new and unique experiences. This study was conducted to identify the long-haul travel motivation by international tourists to Penang. A total of 400 respondents participated in this survey, conducted around the tourist attractions in Penang, using cluster random sampling. However, only 370 questionnaires were only used for this research. Data were analysed using SPSS software 22 version. The findings, ‘knowledge and novelty seeking' were the main push factors that drove long-haul travel by international tourists to Penang. Meanwhile, the main pull factor that attracts long- haul travel by international tourists to Penang was its ‘culture and history'. Additionally, there were partly direct and significant relationships between socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation (push factors and pull factors). Overall, this study identified the long-haul travel motivations by international tourists to Penang based on socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation and has indirectly helped in understanding the long-haul travel market particularly for Penang and Southeast Asia. This research also suggested for an effective marketing and promotion strategy in pro- viding useful information that is the key to attract international tourists to travel long distances.

The path from the first draft sequence to our nascent era of personal genomes and genomic medicine has been made possible only because of the extraordinary advancements in DNA sequencing technologies over the past 10 years. Here, we discuss commonly used high-throughput sequencing platforms, the growing array of sequencing assays developed around them, as well as the challenges facing current sequencing platforms and their clinical application.},
